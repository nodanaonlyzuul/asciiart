### Notes

#### Rehabilitation & being a better citizen

This gem started as a fast-and-loose side project in 2014.
It mostly worked for many years, with no need for major updates.
In January 2022, I noticed a lot of the gem & its dependencies' syntax didn't play well in modern versions of Ruby.

#### Tagging & Github Releases

This is the version where I started caring about using tags & GH releases.

### Fixed

  * Fixing ability to open a URL via cli.[[#12](https://github.com/nodanaonlyzuul/asciiart/pull/12)]
  * Fixing color output issues.[[#12](https://github.com/nodanaonlyzuul/asciiart/pull/12)]

## < 0.2.0

These were the dark ages.
I'm sorry.
